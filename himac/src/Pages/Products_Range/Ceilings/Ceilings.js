            description="Ceilings are very important to absorb the sound in any of the room. Sound travel in a wave form and most of the reflections hit the ceiling first. Ceiling help to dampen the sound to the utmost. Ceiling tiles are common now a days as most of the people install the ceilings for the purpose of decorations or for the fixation of the lighting arrangements. But, the very important element which is always ignored while installing the ceiling tiles are the acoustic requirements.

            Sitting in a big room with a gypsum decorative ceiling and watching and understanding the speech of the TV is as difficult as you are watching cinema in a hall 30 years back. As the entire surfaces of your areas are reflective and the RT 60 is high, you will not be able to understand the sound clearly which simply means that the ceilings like gypsum are not perfect for the rooms where you want to communicate or watch TV. This is always better you install acoustical ceilings instead of the normal ceilings. These ceilings are good for thermal insulations that means these will save energy also. The wood Fiber Cement Composite Ceilings are best known for its acoustic quality and broadband frequency absorption. The absorption properties of wood fiber cement composite are always better than any chemical bonded acoustic product as the core of the cement bonded acoustic tile is softer as compare to any chemical bonded product which is hard in nature. So, you will always love to watch the TV in an acoustically treated room instead of a normal room with the gypsum.
            
            Acoustic ceiling is important and is not only for residential, but this is very useful for the big spaces like offices, classrooms, audio visual rooms, conference rooms and many more. Classrooms are the most important segment where acoustic tile is used widely now a days with the simple reason that classrooms are for the exchange of the communication. As the classrooms are meant for the exchange of communication, proper speech clarity or proper distribution of the sound is very important, otherwise, audibility between the sender and receiver will be very poor and nobody will be understanding anything. Since wood fiber cement composite have very good sound absorbing characteristics, this will do perfectly well even applicated only in the ceilings. The wood fiber tiles are a green product and have a long life as compare to any other ceilings. These are good for thermal insulations, fire retardant, termite resistant, water resistant and possess very good absorption properties.
            
            So, next time whenever you plan for ceiling irrespective of the site such as Home, Gym, Office, Restaurant or any other site. Plan for the acoustic ceilings rather than any normal ceilings. These may be slightly costlier than the normal ceiling but these are the long-term investments."
