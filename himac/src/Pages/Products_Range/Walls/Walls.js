            description="Whenever we think of soundproofing of walls, this become very important to identify that for which purpose, we want to soundproof the walls. Whether you want to stop the sound transmission coming from your neighbor’s house or whether you want to improve the quality of sound / speech clarity within your space, such as studio or home theater or a room for watching Television. There are two kinds of the wall panels, first type of panel is called blockers which means they block the sound, in other words they will increase the blocking value of your existing walls and stop the sound transmission travelling from outside to your house. These sounds may be the sounds from your neighbor’s house, the traffic sound or any other sound which disturbs you. These sound blocking materials stop noise traveling through walls, floors, ceilings from one space to another. Sound blockers are typically hard, heavy, thick, and in some cases flexible materials that block noise. It is important to mention here that the sound blockers are only for blocking the sound and these will not improve the sound quality or speech clarity. Infect, these could increase the reverberations inside the application areas. To keep noise from entering a room, these blockers are installed in walls, ceilings, floors, and doors. The property of these blockers is defined as STC (Sound Transmission Class) which means the capacity of the product to block the sound. Higher the STC, the better will be the blocking properties.

            Second type of materials for walls are the Sound absorbing materials to protect the sound from reverberating inside a room and to improving sound or speech quality inside the room. Sound absorbing materials are porous, lightweight, and soft in nature. These may not soft to touch, but the softness depends upon its core which absorbs the sound. For example, a foam panel may be soft to touch as compare to the wood fiber cement composite. But the absorption properties are always better in the wood fiber cement composite due to its softer core and not due to its hardness while touch. In both cases, the higher the rating, the more effective the product. The properties of the absorbing materials are defined as NRC (Noise Reduction Coefficient). It is the capacity of the product to absorb the sound. As a thumb rule, higher the NRC, better will be the speech clarity."
