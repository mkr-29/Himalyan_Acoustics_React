            description="Banquet Halls are the places, which are built to host thefunctions like marriages, events, parties etc. Most of the banquets are big in structure as these are meant for large gatherings. Many of the banquet halls are small also to hold the small functions. The common element between all the banquets is their structure, which is most of the time is large or big in terms ofarea, height, or gathering. Banquets are made to enjoy the events, parties which are incomplete without loud music. As most of the times these banquet halls are large with heights of around 20â€™ and above, the reverberations during playing of sound system become very high. To reduce the reverberations effective acoustic treatments are required. Small banquets could be treated easily acoustically because of the limited space. But,to treat large halls acoustically are always a challenge as these has to be designed keeping in mind the aesthetic aspects also. Although, these solutions are expensive, but good solutions in controlled budgets are always there, if treated technically.

            Most of the banquets arein an independent building near to residential areas. The concept of banquet is also very common in hotel buildings. All these are the places where there is a high risk of noise transmission issues to the nearby areas and even inside the premise too. Noise pollution norms are very strict these days and normally high-volume sound is not allowed in late nights and the standard limits inside the banquet halls are also prescribed under the law.
            
            All excessive sounds are injurious to our ears and these may lead to several diseases like hypertension, hearing disorders etc. So, while designing acoustic in a banquet hall the basic things which we have to keep in our mind is the structure and dimensions of the building, its occupancy during the event and the purpose of the event. Banquets are normally near to the residential areas, so we have to treat it with absorption, insulations and isolations, so that the sound shall not go to the adjoining areas to make them disturb.
            
            For banquets in hotels, most of the time above these banquet halls there are private rooms and there is always high risk of sound and vibration transmission from the banquet to the upper rooms through the structures or any other reason. So, these kinds of siteshave to be treated differently. Himalyan Acoustic is having wide range of products to stop the structural transmissions and vibrations in such sites. Himalyan is also having wide range of products for absorption and insulation which could give you better results with the minimum acoustics."
