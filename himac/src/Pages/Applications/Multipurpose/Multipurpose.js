            description="Multipurpose hall as an area which could be used for multiple kind of activities. This could be used for Cultural Events, Speeches, debates, music events, live events, sometime sports activities too. Today most of the multipurpose halls are projecting movies also. As the multipurpose hall is for so many kinds of activities, we have to keep in mind all these activities while designing the acoustics. All these activities need different treatments, if treated individually. But, in multipurposehall, we have to sum up the entire acoustic in one design which could behave perfect while performing all kind of activities. We have to plan the acoustic design as per the certain RT60 keeping in mind the above-mentioned activities. The length, width, and height of the ceiling height is very important to determine a roomâ€™s cubic volume.The type of construction material used in the construction of the hall also plays a vital role in acoustics. The surfaces like ceiling, walls, flooring, windows, even furnishings could reflect the sound. Materials such as concrete block, bricks, partitions, type of flooring, and under decking have acoustical values that can be calculated while designing for acoustics. This is very important to see the ceiling weather this a truss or a concrete ceiling. In both the cases acoustic treatment will be different.

            Occupancy also plays a major role while designing for acoustics in a multipurpose hall as human body is absorptive, people also absorb sound and therefore, the total occupancy affects the hall acoustics. RT60 is always different in an empty and fully occupied space.If the multipurpose hall is not treated with acoustics or with improper acoustics, the original sounds in the room start reflecting from surface to surface resulting the bad speech clarity resulting into unequal distribution of sound amongst the people sitting inside the hall. This will result in an increase in background noise which will give rise to echoes and inaudible sounds and the hall needs acoustical treatment. The sound of HVAC or fans are also important while treatment of the multipurpose hall.
            
            Acoustic is a science and based on mathematical calculations. You can always calculate the acoustical site conditions before and after application of the acoustic materials. The important thing which requires for the successful treatment of the multipurpose hall are that (a) acoustic design shall be good as per the structure of the hall (b) Good and affective sound-absorbing panels around the are used onwalls, ceiling and stage areas.
            
            Ceiling is the most important part while treatment for acoustics as sound travel in the wave form and major of the reflection hit ceiling so high NRC value panels are important for the ceilings. We have alarge variety of acoustic panels for walls, ceiling and stage applications. In the ceiling you can use products like flat ceiling, clouds and baffles etc. The products are the technical products and are extremely durable, can be installed on T24 Grid or with the frameworks.
            
            For the walls also are many options for acoustical treatments ranging from the panels of wood fiber in fibrous finish, plane finish, 3D finish, Designer finish, stretch fabric, fabric wrapped panel, polyester panel, wooden panel and many more. These panels could be cut, nailed easily and could be customized for the special applications."
